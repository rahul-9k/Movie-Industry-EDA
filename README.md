# Movie Industry EDA

## Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the movie industry, leveraging a dataset from IMDB that spans 25 years (2000–2025). The analysis delves into a rich collection of movie data—budgets, domestic and worldwide gross earnings, ratings, genres, and release dates—to uncover trends and insights that can inform filmmaking decisions. Rather than simply cataloging statistics, this EDA explores the factors that contribute to a movie’s success, shedding light on which types of films and genres tend to perform best financially, how budget levels impact profitability, and the influence of release timing on box office outcomes. The result is a data-driven perspective on what makes movies thrive in a competitive market.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis environment.

## Key Findings
- Action and Adventure films often lead in profitability, with strong returns relative to their budgets.
- Mid-range budgets ($50M–$100M) strike an effective balance between investment and earnings potential.
- Releases during summer months (June–August) and year-end holidays (November–December) tend to maximize gross revenue.
